# Global CNN based on NUFFT

This is an experimental code implementing 

- an adapted version of DeepMD for classification tasks

- a global CNN algorithm using NUFFT with trainable Fouier multipliers


The repo is organized as follows: 

-```src/``` : contains the source files

-```run/``` : it contains the examples encoded in Json files. 

-```experimental/``` : it contains experimental features being explored
